# typescript-maps

## What

A mini app that gets the basics of TypeScript covered.

## Why

I don't know TypeScript and need to get my TS going, especially in React apps. Saving it on GH because it'll be a good reference.

## Who

Tutorial: Stephen Grider's "React and Typescript: build a portfolio project" for TS overview.

Notes:
Google Maps API removed. Gitcher own.

Run parcel index.html from the command line to spin up.
Data comes from Faker, which will allow users and company to float in the middle of the ocean; however, there's enough trash on the surface that I assume is acting as a raft.
